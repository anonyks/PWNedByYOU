# PWNedByYOU

PWNedByYOU is a double-encoded HTML defacement script that offers a unique and adaptable approach to web page defacement. By prompting the user for a name, it allows the defacement message to be personalized without the need to create multiple scripts for each instance. The tool utilizes double encoding to help bypass restrictions based on HTML codes and keywords, making it versatile and effective for various uses.

## Features
- **Customizable Defacement**: Users can input any name to be displayed on the defaced web page.
- **Double Encoding**: Enhances the ability to bypass common HTML content restrictions.
- **Versatile**: Suitable for security researchers and penetration testers who need to demonstrate web page vulnerabilities.

## How It Works
The script uses JavaScript's `unescape` function to decode encoded HTML entities twice, thus bypassing filters that detect standard HTML. This allows the insertion of potentially harmful or unauthorized content in a manner that evades detection.
